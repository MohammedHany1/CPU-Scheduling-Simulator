# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator

About the Project

This Project simulates the following schedulers:

  - Priority Scheduling.

  - Shortest-Job First Scheduling.

  - Shortest-Remaining Time First Scheduling.

  - AGAT Scheduling:

      - Each process have a different quantum

      - A new factor based on (priority, arrival time, and remaining service time) is attached to each submitted process
    
      - Process is converted from non-preemptive AGAT after 40% of quantum time to Pre-emptive AGAT.
